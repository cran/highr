        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument 'fallback' in hilight(); for R < 3.0.0, we can use
  hilight(..., fallback = TRUE), which is a rough syntax highlighting method
  based on regular expressions (hence less accurate and comphrehensive than
  the getParseData() approach); as a result, highr no longer has to depend
  on R 3.0.0, although it is recommended to use R 3.0.0


        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.1

NEW FEATURES

  o the first version of highr: a hilight() function based on
  utils::getParseData() to do syntax highlighting for R code; hi_andrew() as
  a wrapper for Andre Simon's Highlight package
